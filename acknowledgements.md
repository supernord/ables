Researchers who use ABLeS resources are expected to acknowledge ABLeS in any resulting publications, presentations, or research outputs.

## Citing and acknowledging ABLeS

The ABLeS program should be both cited and acknowledged in any publication, presentation or grant application that was supported by data or services provided by ABLeS.

1. Use the following citation:

```

2. Use the following acknowledgement statement:

```
"The authors acknowledge the provision of computing and data resources provided by the Australian BioCommons Leadership Share (ABLeS) program. This program is co-funded by Bioplatforms Australia (enabled by NCRIS), the National Computational Infrastructure and Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre."
```

## ABLeS co-authorship policy

For routine or standard services (e.g. tool installation or access to compute infrastructure), a formal acknowledgement of ABLeS is sufficient.

In some cases, co-authorship may be appropriate.

This typically applies where ABLeS support staff or specialists at NCI or Pawsey have made a substantial intellectual contribution to the work, such as:
- Development or optimisation of methods, protocols, or pipelines
- Study design input
- Data or results analysis
- Interpretation of findings

We approach authorship discussions collaboratively and in the spirit of fair and transparent attribution.

## Share your outputs

We encourage all projects to inform the ABLeS team of publications, software releases, datasets, and other outputs arising from ABLeS-supported work. Sharing outcomes helps demonstrate national impact and strengthens continued support for the community.

Visit our [**Sharing project outputs** page](ables/sharing.md) to learn how to notify us and be featured.
