The ABLeS (Australian BioCommons Leadership Share) program was established in April 2021 to more readily support data-driven bioinformatics. This effort is supported by [Australian BioCommons](https://www.biocommons.org.au/) in partnership with [Bioplatforms Australia](https://bioplatforms.com/), the [National Computational Infrastructure (NCI, Canberra)](https://nci.org.au/), and the [Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre (Pawsey, Perth)](https://pawsey.org.au/). 

ABLeS offers access to:

- computational and data infrastructure;
- specialized expertise;
- support on adopting best practices and effectively sharing outputs;
- a community-driven repository of bioinformatics software, including tools and workflows.
