ABLeS is available to research groups and bioinformatics communities across Australia.

Read below to determine if your project aligns with our core principles and resource criteria:

| Reference Data                          | Production Bioinformatics                                      | Software Accelerator                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| You are creating high-quality data assets (e.g., a reference genome) intended for broad community reuse. | You are running established, best-practice pipelines for a large-scale research consortium. | You are developing, testing, or optimizing bioinformatics tools for the wider community. |

## Core eligibility criteria

To qualify, your project must meet the following three pillars:

#### Pillar 1: Domain and Impact
-  **Life Sciences focus**: Your work must be biological or medical in nature.
- **Open outputs**: You are committed to sharing your results (data, software, or methods) with the broader research community and ABLeS. (Read more abour this [here](ables/sharing.md)). 

#### Pillar 2: Technical Readiness
- **Internal expertise**: Your team must have the "hands-on" bioinformatics skills required to execute the work.
- **HPC readiness**: You are prepared to work within the NCI or Pawsey supercomputing environments.

#### Pillar 3: Responsible Resource Use
- **Finite resources**: You acknowledge that HPC compute and storage are limited; you have a plan to use them efficiently.
- **Active management**: You agree to a 6-month progress review to ensure resources are being utilized effectively.

## Governance and Leadership

Every ABLeS project requires a clear leadership structure to ensure accountability:

- **Project Lead**: one person is responsible for all resource usage and adherence to facility policies.

- **Collaborative decision-making**: for larger groups, a steering committee or working group must be in place to allow collaborative decision making mechanism and align with community priorities.

- **Compliance**: All users must abide by the [NCI Terms and Conditions](https://nci.org.au/users/nci-terms-and-conditions-access) and [Pawsey Conditions of Access](https://pawsey.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/US/overview).

- **Collaboration & consultation**: ABLeS is collaborative and involves BioCommons, the research community, and the computational facilities. It is also a standing item for discussion and forums play a strong role in managing the use of ABLeS: groups will thus engage with BioCommons in an open and collaborative manner, with regular meetups.
